Project Orezm - Sharing Top Tier VPN Server & Setups
====================================================

Welcome aboard. My name is Ernest, I’m a professional software engineer and solution expert, and I’ve been a developer for over 15 years. I’m here to help you get rid of internet restriction and censorships in case you are traveling or staying in mainland China. 

**Project Orezm** is not competing with those global leaders of the industry, such as Nord VPN and Express VPN. It’s just focusing on how to handle with the PRC’s weird network policy well, so than we can keep you out of being blocked by the GFW. If you're staying or planning to in China, then **Awesome VPN** would be your best choice.

4. VPN and Proxy, You Got Both
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We’re not going to kill a fly with an elephant gun. Our powerful proxy is suitable for most situations for connection speed and convenience reasons, though choice is on you.

    There are no limitations on rate and bandwidth of your subscription. So **the actual rate of connection mostly depends on which network you choose to connect to the server with**. If your Wi-Fi performs differently from hour to hour, always using cellphone network will bring you the best experience.
