How long will it take for confirmation?
---------------------------------------
I will deal with it as soon as I receive your subscription message. It will never take more than 1 hour.

What's the limition of bandwidth?
---------------------------------
There is no limitation on bandwidth. Please feel free and enjoy.

Why do i got low speed sometimes?
---------------------------------
There is no limitation on connection rate. The actual rate mostly depends on which 
network you choose to connect to the server with. If your Wi-Fi performs differently 
from hour to hour, always using cellphone network will bring you the best experience.

How many devices can I connect to VPN simultaneously?
-----------------------------------------------------
Since I promised you will get the top tier experience with Awesome VPN, 
and there will be no more than 10 users connect to the server at the same moment, 
so of course these 10 users must be identified with different accounts,
thus, multiple connections with the same account is not allow. Using Proxy would be 
a good choice to share your account among different devices. And there is no limitation 
on number of devices you use with.

Will outbound IP change daily?
------------------------------
No. Although inbound IP will change daily to avoid being blocked by the Chinese government,
outbound IP always remains the same.
